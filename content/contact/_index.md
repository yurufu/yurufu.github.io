### About Me

Welcome! I am a doctoral student in Political Science at National Taiwan University and currently serve as project coordinator for the Civil Defense and Democracy Resilience Project at Emory University. My research interests include judicial politics, legal mobilization, contentious politics, state–society relations, and democratization.

At present, I am developing several projects on authoritarian nostalgia and democratic resilience in East Asia, with a particular emphasis on Taiwan. These projects examine how transitional justice shapes public trust in democratic institutions, how the judicialization of politics influences perceptions of state legitimacy, and how welfare fairness affects democratic solidarity. I also contribute to collaborative survey and experimental research on public support for economic coercive measures and cross-strait security issues, working with co-authors at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign and Academia Sinica.

I received my M.A. in Political Science from National Taiwan University in 2017, where my thesis “The State Against Citizens: Blame-shifting Litigation and the Judicialization of Politics in Taiwan” received the Best Dissertation Award from the Taiwan Political Science Association. This work advanced a state-centered perspective on legal mobilization, arguing that administrative agencies use civil lawsuits to constrain social movements and evade accountability. The argument was developed through participant observation in anti-eviction activism and archival research on closed-factory protests, and was presented at the Law and Society Association (2017) and the American Political Science Association (2017).

My methodological training spans both quantitative and qualitative approaches. I have studied game theory, logistic regression, and time-series cross-sectional analysis, and completed the Institute of Political Methodology (IPM) summer program. In that setting, I presented a project reinterpreting political insurance theory, showing how judicial independence reforms can empower opposition parties and reshape elite bargaining.

I earned my B.A. in Political Science with a minor in Law from National Chung Cheng University.
